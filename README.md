# Happy Thoughts

Mission was to practice React state skills by fetching and posting data to an API.

## The problem

I started by writing with paper and pen, parts and how they could work together, based on the brief. 
First I tested the API using Postman, to see what is happening and what "data" I could use. Than I started to code in VS Code. I tried using Components and props and if I had more time I would have done that even more. 

I used moment.js for time, a little validation and a counter. 
I did the design a little bit "banana-colorized" as I thought the grey/black design guide was not that "happy".
